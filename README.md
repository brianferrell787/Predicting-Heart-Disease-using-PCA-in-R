# Predicting-Heart-Disease-using-PCA-in-R
This was a school project for my machine learning algorithms class to apply machine learning methods to a dataset to develop predictive models. The project was intended to give experience in applying machine learning methods for data analysis, tuning paramters, and communicating results. class. 


# Project Report
After your project proposal has been approved, apply your proposed techniques to the dataset and
summarize the results in a report. Be sure to use proper practices in the empirical evaluation of
predictive methods. The analysis should contain two main parts:
1. Apply one method with at least one tuning parameter (for example, classification trees or
SVM for classification, regression trees or lasso linear regression for regression). The method
that you use do not necessarily need to be methods that we covered in class. You must
use appropriate model-selection techniques and tune the parameters for the technique. The
method should be tested using the same test data. Report on which variables are important
for prediction.
2. Apply principal component analysis to your data with the response column removed. Using
the scores corresponding to the first 5 principal components, build a model that predicts the
response with the method in the previous part. Compare the performance of the two models.
Note that you will need to pre-process the test data in the same manner as the training data.
The report should be written in narrative form using complete sentences and correct grammar.
Submit your report in .pdf format via Blackboard. Turn in your code and data, if possible and
appropriate, in a .zip file.
